If you're already using NPM and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (learn more):
npm install firebase

Then, initialise Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products that you'd like to use.
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use

// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries


// Your web app's Firebase configuration

const firebaseConfig = {

  apiKey: "AIzaSyDzdm4NYJi7XMVXj7DPpd3PPpWP4OSZlQU",

  authDomain: "week7-umair.firebaseapp.com",

  projectId: "week7-umair",

  storageBucket: "week7-umair.firebasestorage.app",

  messagingSenderId: "12311454294",

  appId: "1:12311454294:web:1125e0ca0d1d5b41d451f7"

};


// Initialize Firebase

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
